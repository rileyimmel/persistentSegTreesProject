1) Executive Summary: 4-8 page description of everything that has been delivered in this packet / project.
2) Implementation: In C++, Java, and Python. The code needs to be thoroughly commented.
3) Instructional Slides: Two sets of instructional slides. The first, a thorough, well designed, informative slideset that briefly teach the topic to an advanced undergraduate audience (about one lecture or 10-15 slides in length). A second, shorter, set of slides will be submitted that will be used for your 10 minute presentation.
4) PC: Custom Programming Challenge: A programming assignment that asks students to use the algorithm in question, but with at least one notable twist / change to the topic / algorithm in question.
5) PC Test Cases: At least 20 test cases that cover likely edge cases and test for speed / efficiency.

## Implementation

These do not currently take input from the user as they are simply examples of an implementation of the data structure.
They do, however, include sample cases to showcase their functionality. These sample cases can be observed by running
program (ex. for C++, running ./pst will print out the results of the sample cases).

### C++
Filename: PST.cpp

How to run:
- Make sure you have CMake installed
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./pst
```
